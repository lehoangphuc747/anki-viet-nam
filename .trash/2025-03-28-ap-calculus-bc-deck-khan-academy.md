## Description

Each flashcard in this deck links to one Khan Academy exercise. Together, the flashcards in this deck cover every exercise in the free [AP Calculus BC](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/ap-calculus-ab-and-bc-course-and-exam-description.pdf) **[Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-bc)** course.

The purpose of this deck is turn AP Calculus BC Khan Academy practice exercises into flashcards that can be "space repetition-ized" by Anki.

⭐️ The pros of such **Khan Academy exercise** cards ⭐️:

1. Khan Academy's collection of exercises pretty comprehensively covers all of AP Calculus BC
2. The exercises indirectly test your knowledge of concepts and formulas
3. Unlike normal flashcards, exercises allow you to directly practice and apply knowledge to actual problems.

Additionally, even with all the advantages: this deck took way less time to make than my [other decks](https://ankiweb.net/shared/by-author/2099309714). Thank you dear people at Khan Academy for all the hard work!!
